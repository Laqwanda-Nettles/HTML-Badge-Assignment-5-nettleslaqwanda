<h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  This is my first HTML assignment based off of building a fake E-Commerce Website. It's loosely modeled after the real restaurant Pitmasters Back Alley BBQ. It has three pages - home, menu, and about. It features a table with fictitous prices and contact information. It also includes images on each page.
  </p>
<h2>Wireframe</h2>
  <p>
  This is my plan for the website without using CSS. The wireframe was created on Canva.com
  </p>
<img src="pm1-wireframe.png" alt="website wireframe"/>
<h2>Technology used</h2>
  <p>
  The project uses HTML to structure the website.

<h2>Credits and Acknowledgements</h2>

  Images were mostly copied from google.com and the Pitmasters website.

  Parts of the HTML were refrenced from MDN.
